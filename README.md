# E-commerce Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves an in-depth analysis of an e-commerce dataset using Python. The primary objective is to explore sales data, extract meaningful insights, and visualize trends that can help improve business decisions. The analysis covers various aspects such as customer behavior, product performance, sales trends, and key performance indicators (KPIs).

## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, duplicates, and data transformation to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Descriptive statistics, data visualization, and identifying patterns in sales and customer behavior.
- **Sales Performance Analysis:** Analysis of sales performance across different time periods, products, and categories.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Clustering customers based on purchasing behavior to identify key segments.
- **Product Insights:** Identifying top-selling products, underperforming items, and category-wise sales trends.
- **Sales Forecasting:** Time series analysis to predict future sales trends based on historical data.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core programming language used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** An interactive environment for writing and running code.
- **Pandas:** For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization and plotting graphs.
- **NumPy:** For numerical data operations.
- **Scikit-learn:** For implementing machine learning models for customer segmentation and sales forecasting.

## Project Structure

- **`ecomDProject.ipynb`:** The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code, analysis, and visualizations.
- **`data/`:** Directory containing the e-commerce dataset used in the project (not included in the repository; ensure to add your dataset here).
- **`images/`:** Folder containing visualizations and plots generated from the analysis.

## Key Insights

1. **Sales Trends:** Identification of peak sales periods, seasonal trends, and sales dips.
2. **Top Customers:** Analysis of customer purchase frequency and total expenditure to identify VIP customers.
3. **High-Performing Products:** Insights into products that drive the most revenue and those with the highest margins.
4. **Customer Segmentation:** Cluster analysis revealing key customer segments that can be targeted for personalized marketing.
5. **Future Sales Forecasts:** Predictive models indicating potential future sales trends to aid inventory and marketing strategies.
